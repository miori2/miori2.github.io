subtitle: Developing Algorithms & Machine Learning Systems
project_title: "Developing Cutting-Edge Algorithmic Approaches to Refine Machine Learning Systems for Complex Nonlinear Optimization in Biomedical Research"

problem: |
  Machine learning systems used in biomedical research often struggle with complex nonlinear optimization problems, which can hamper the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of predictive models and data analysis. These challenges arise because biomedical data is typically noisy and nonlinear, making it difficult for standard machine learning algorithms to perform well without significant adaptation.


approach: |
  The project aims to develop novel algorithmic approaches to enhance machine learning systems. This will include:

  - Designing novel optimization algorithms that can better handle the nonlinearity of biomedical data.
  - Train machine learning models to decode certain patterns
  - Integrate real-time signal classification
  - Evaluate system performance in daily activities

  Tools such as MathLab, Python, R, and Anaconda (an open source platform that includes over 200 packages tailored for data science will be used in the project.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in improved prediction ability of machine learning systems and more efficient training of these systems.
