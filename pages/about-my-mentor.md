    The experience and accomplishments of Dr. Iyiola are nearly innumerable. Across his 20+ years of experience in academia and research, he has obtained master's degrees in Business Administration, Science, and Mathematics, and a PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics. He has published over 100 research articles on topics ranging from computing a fractional diffusion equation model for cancer tumors to finding exact solutions of generalized multidimensional mathematical physics models via the sub-equation model.
    
    Not only is he a brilliant researcher, but Dr. Iyiola has mentored dozens of students and has been successful in unleashing their potential. At the G.R.I.N.D Conference hosted by Morgan State University, four of his mentees presented theses on their research topics in 3-minute presentations, with two of the four mentees being awarded for their excellence and one of them becoming the first-ever grand winner. This showcases Dr. Iyiola's commitment and success in creating a bright future in the industry.
