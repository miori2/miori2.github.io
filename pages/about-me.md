  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2026.

    My work involves designing, programming, creating, implementing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. In SAIRI I'm apart of the Developing Cutting-Edge Algorithmic Approaches to Refine Machine Learning Systems for Complex Nonlinear Optimization in Biomedical Research team.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy improving my coding skill, reading books, and watching various television shows.
