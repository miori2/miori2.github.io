  Today I continued reviewing the research paper I was assigned. 'Comparative analysis of heart disease prediction using logistic regression, SVM, KNN, and random forest with cross-validation for improved accuracy'. To give a brief summary of the paper, it argues for the use of cross-validation to imrpove machine learning systems to better improve the diagonistic ability of predicitive heart disease models. Their methodology was that they would take four machine learning models (Linear Regression, KNN, SVM, and Random forest) and compare their accuracy using the train-test-split model vs the use of cross validation and compartive metrics. The results they produced showed that cross-validation contributed to improved accuracy across the board for all models.

  No blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Today was just going over the research paper, which I found kind of boring to be honest. The paper itself has an interseting real-world problem they want to solve and their methodology is interesting, my problem is that its just too long-winded and it takes a while to understand the real important stuff they're trying to say in each section. The implementation into Python was also a confusing process, the code provided to us in the study was different than the one they used in the source code, so some of the computations he did like encode the categorical features into binary indicators weren't neccesary in our own code. Little things like that made the whole process tiring,
