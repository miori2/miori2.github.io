  Today I continued reviewing the research paper I was assigned. 'Comparative analysis of heart disease prediction using logistic regression, SVM, KNN, and random forest with cross-validation for improved accuracy'. To give a brief summary of the paper, it argues for the use of cross-validation to imrpove machine learning systems to better improve the diagonistic ability of predicitive heart disease models. Their methodology was that they would take four machine learning models (Linear Regression, KNN, SVM, and Random forest) and compare their accuracy using the train-test-split model vs the use of cross validation and compartive metrics. The results they produced showed that cross-validation contributed to improved accuracy across the board for all models.
