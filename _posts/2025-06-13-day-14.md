what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about the basic modeling concepts that we can use in R. The first one bing Hierarchical Clustering, which is the way finding which cases or observations in your data belong with one another. When attempting to use this method you have to make note of which clustering approach you'll use, the measure of distance, and whether you want start with the case being group together then divided afterwards or the opposite where they are all alone and then grouped together. Two more modeling methods I leanred about were Principal Components were we convert 2D structures into 1D while still retaining all the important information, and Regressions the most powerful method where we use a group of variables to predict the outcome of another. We then ended the day with our Weekly Report.

reflection: |
  The modeling methods in R are a lot to grasp. With Hierarchical Clustering and Principal Components, I'll need more time to really understand the correct implementation for them and recognizing their use cases. For Regression, I have already dealt with it in various math classes with the Regression Line formula Regression = y - x. So I'm a bit more aware of how and where to use it even in a coding enviroment. I thought the presentation we did today was pretty good. I personally think I did a much better job than last time by keeping things brief.
