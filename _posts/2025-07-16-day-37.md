  Today I continued to work on my individual research paper. This time I was focusing on the explanatoy side of my paper, detailing the reasons why this paper and the problems its discussing matter and how we conduct the experiment that either backs or disproves our claim. I went over the introduction part intoducing the Alzheimer's disease and the damage it has caused on a global scale and how machine learning models can help combat it through the use of predictive analysis. I also discussed how the use of the custom ELM we've developed would prove to be more effective than traditional modles. After that I discussed the dataset that I would be using, its features and rows, and the process of cleaning the data through the use techniques like one-hot encoding to convert categorical features into numeric ones and SMOTE to create synthetic samples to balance the data out.

reflection: |
  Today a was a very calm day. We were all working on our papers trying to fit them into the template Ms. Amara provided for us. Our high school teacher member, Mr. Ron, was a big help today for me specifically. I was able to go to him for guidance in structuring my research paper and the grammar I should be employing when trying to offer explanations. One major thing he did that helped me out was finding research papers that covered a similar topic to mine, allowing me to see what they've done, how they structured their paper and how my paper can occupy a unique niche in this subject. Ms. Amara also helped out by providing feedback on the work I've done so far. Overall I was able to get a lot done today.
