  Today instead of heading to our research labs we were called over to the business building to discuss some of our final deliverables. Dr. Mack talked about the elevator pitch and gave us some advice on how to make it engaging and concise. Some examples were shown where some of the pitches had skits before going into detail on their project and others simply let the work speak for themselves. Dr. Mack then talked about the final day of the program where we have to go to some kind of funhouse. Afterwards, she and Michael started our workshop for Overleaf and how we should structured final research paper. They went over on the proper procedure on how we should write the researchers and their affialations and how to use unique symbols and how to input tex files into the document to avoid visual clutter, and also taught how to create automatic references with the use of google scholar and the bibliography function. After our break I went back to my lab to continue work on my research paper.

  No blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Today was pretty stressful for me, not so much because of the assignments given to us but the fact that my laptop decided to stop working with me during the Overleaf assignment and right towards the end of the program. I had to buy a new one after the break and it took up a lot of my time have to redownload all neccesary files and applications (which I'm still haven't finsihed yet). In regards to today's workshop, I have to admit I find the work to be a bit stressful, the elevator pitch isn't all that bad especially with it only being 90 min max but I imagine its going to be a bit hard to coordinate everybody if we decide to go the skit route. For the research paper our team already has experience, the main hang-up for me is if we have to structured our paper in a similar manner as to the temmplate provided to us or we have creative control as long as we follow the standards given to us (input our sections as .tex files, references done the same way as shown, etc).
