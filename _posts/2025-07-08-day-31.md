what_i_learned: |

  I once again worked on my research paper today. I was succesfully able to implement cross-validation on my dataset and train my ML models on them to compare their metrics to one another. It was a very laborious process since we hadn't been taught it before, the best example that I had was the research paper Roji & I worked on that detailed how effective the technique was and its example source code. While implementing it I had to go back to my previous code cells to correct any mistakes that may 'damage' the final output, during the review process I realized I had been using the custom ELM to get the metrics of both it and its traditional variant so I was able to correct that. Afterwards I was able to get technique working and I was able to get the metrics for each model, now I'm going to be focusing on the activation functions (Sigmoid, tanh, relu) to see how model performance differs when each one is applied.

  I had trouble getting the accuracy of my models when using cross-validation, trying to get the correct shape of my data is still a problem for me when it comes to the training and testing portion of Machine learning.
  
reflection: |
  Today was pretty boring. I'm happy to have finally gotten my implementation of cross-validation working. I had so much trouble at first with building it, the code the research paper I mentioned provided me with a bit of guidance but it was really Ms. Amara's that I was able to pull it off succesfully. It was still pretty hard to do though, I had a lot of trouble with the syntax especially, it pretty annoying to encounter an error nearly every other line. Moving on from cross-validation, now that I know I made an error in regard to implementing the normal ELM, I'll have to go home today and debug my data to see if I made anymore mistakes.
