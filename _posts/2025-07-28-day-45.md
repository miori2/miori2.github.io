  Today I was just working on our final deliverables the research paper and the final presentation. In the morning I was working on my side of the methodology for one of the two data sets we will be reporting on: Alzheimer's Disease. My main goal was trying to successfully implement the ASAIM algorithm into my code and get the needed metrics from it (Accuracy, RMSE, RMSE Diff) and turn that data into a bar chart format to use as an easy way to show off the data. Afterwards I worked with my teammates to fill out the presentation slides. For the introduction we copied the slides from our mid-summer presentation into the final one and added some extra slides to give better context. At the end of the day we were discussing who will present what and in what order.

  I had some trouble with the cross-validation method for my models. It's strange because last week it was working just fine.
  
reflection: |
  Today was just focusing on finishing up our work. The ASAIM implementation was a bit of a struggle for me but thankfully MS. Amara and Roji were able to help me figure things out. Some of the other work I did such as on our research paper were just reviewing my work and adding the proper citations when needed and in the proper section. For our final presentation slides we simply took the work we've been doing all this time (research papers, balancing data, cross-validation) along with the coding work we've been doing up till now and the slides from the mid-summer presentation and put them in the powerpoint. After cleaning up and adding some additional slides when neccesary we talked about ideas for presenting.
