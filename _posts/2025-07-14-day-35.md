  I wasn't in the office for most of the day due to a Doctor's appointment. I arrived at 1:30 so I wasn't able to accomplish too much today. Ms. Amara told us the importance of translanting our research work into a story, as in telling people what we've been doing and why it matters and why they should listen. She gave us a list of categories to follow when creating our story. For example, first off is the Introduction, what we are writing about and how it matters. 2. Explaining the dataset, detailing every aspect about the data we're using and all its features. 3. Data Cleaning, what was done to get the data in a state where we can use it to train our models, etc. In terms of my own work, I was able to detail the data cleaning section of my paper and was able to provide two heatmaps of the unbalanced and balanced versions of my dataset in order to show the correlation of features in both.

reflection: |

  My time was limited today so I don't really feel as though I have much to reflect on. Our graduate mentor Dr. Iyiola was been talking to us about making our papers more relatable to the audience so the task assigned to us today isn't too suprising. The categories we've been assigned to fill out aren't too hard to understand, I just imagine its going to take a while. The literature review we did two weeks ago will really help us out in making our papers more relatable. We are also lucky to have members like Mr. Rona and Ms. Amara to help us make our papers match the industry standard.
