what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to create dictionaries, where the indexes can be named and assigned their values manually in contrast to lists. I learned dictionary exclusive functions such as dict.keys(), dict.values(), dict.items() to better locate the information I want. I also learned how to store my dictionaries as tables where each key acts as a column heading and each row a different record. I leaarned about sets which are data structures which features mutable collections of immutable data like ints and its characteristic of not having duplicates. I also learned about its main purpose that it can perform operations to compare and contrast sets. I also learned about the libraries Numpy and Pandas. The former, Numpy, is important for its powerful data structure ndarrays. As they are able to turn themselves from list-like data structures into tables with columns and headings. The other data structure Pandas, has two data structures of note: Series, where you can provide custom index labels, and DataFrames, a powerful tool that is able to convert various data types into tables.

  No blockers, just a lot to process.

reflection: |
  Today was a very informative day, I learned about more data strucutures to store data and more functions and attributes to manipulate them. The libraries that I learned today would have been of great help in my earlier classes. Overall this was a lot of information to catch up on. Based off today I will need to re-review some of the topics I was introduced to today. For example, I know for a fact I won't be able to remember a good amount of the functions such as np.flatten() where a multi-dimensional array is converted into a 1D version, or attributes such as .flipir() and .flipud() where the tables created from the arrays are flipped, horizontally and vertically respectively.
