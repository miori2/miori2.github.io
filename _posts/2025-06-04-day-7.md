what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to create dictionaries, where the indexes can be named and assigned their values manually in contrast to lists. I learned dictionary exclusive functions such as dict.keys(), dict.values(), dict.items() to better located the information I want. I also learned how to store my dictionaries as tables where each key acts as a column heading and each row a different record. I leaarned about sets which are data structures which features mutable collections of immutable data like ints and its characteristic of not having duplicates.
