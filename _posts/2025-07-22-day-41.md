what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on the first draft of our elevator pitch, we wrote down the lines we would say on a shared google doc and we had our high school teacher Mr. Ron help us with practice my timing how long each of us takes to say our own part. After a bit of practice we then recorded our work on a zoom meeting and used our research work as a visual. As a reward for our hard work, Ron brought out his VR headset and this application called 'Flight' so we could mess around in virtual landscapes of the real world. It was a fun time and a nice teambuilding experience that led to many interesting coversations. After we took our lunch break we went back to building our final research paper, I was revising my own paper to make sure all the experiment results were correct while discussing with the group how our final paper would look.

  No blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Today was an interesting day. In regards to the elevator pitch, I feel as though we could do a better job with the pitch then we currently have. From the way I see it, I don't know if the choice to focus on the optimization of machine learning models instead of the disease prediction aspect of it is the right choice. I also don't think our delivery is the cleanest, we all kind of have to rush when we are talking and the information we are divulging feels a bit too technical for an advertistment (though considering this is for people in the industry I guess that isn't too much of a big deal). My main problem though is the lack of creativity, nothing we did isn't something another group could have done. Despite that I think tommorow will be able to add some flair to it after having some time to brainstorm new ideas.
