  Today we officially started working on our final research paper today. In the morning, Ms. Amara held a team meeting where she explained what the ASAIM algorithm is. The explanations she gave were a bit too techincal for me to properly recite in this blogpost but to give a summary based off my own understanding: ASAIM is a algorithm that is able to optimize the weights of a neural network (weights are the parameters our models use to decide what they learn and how much) by implementing adaptive updates to a model to make it more adaptable to whatever data our models are being trained on. This increases our generalization and reduces overfitting for any model we apply this algorithm too. Improving performance all-around. We implemented this algorithm into the new datasets Ms. Amara provided us to compare its performance to other models we've been using (Traditional ELM, KNN, SVM).

  Had some difficulty understanding and implementing ASAIM.

  We were able to make a lot of progess today. Ms. Amara partnered me with Roji for performing the experiement with models vs ASAIM with an Alzheimers dataset so thanks to her I was able to perform the evaluations for the train-test-split method of our data. She also helped me out with how to implement the ASAIM algorithm inside our code (we basically just copy and paste with some modifications). After plotting the results I went to my research paper to start work on the Introduction. I only have a small draft as of now but I will continue to work on it at home and have Ron or Ms. Amara review my work. We also did our final recording of the elevator pitch today, we decided to just keep things simple and record on zoom without the posters. As with how we setup the cameras it was too hard to see them.
