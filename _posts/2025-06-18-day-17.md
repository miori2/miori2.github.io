what_i_learned: |
  Due to tommorow's holiday our Cohort Connect was moved to today so before research I went there. We went over some of the more basic aspects of the program like the proper way to use the Absence Form and how to use GAD to see the statues of your check. Our coordinators had us give a brief 90 second summary of our project to our high school faculty member. Unfortunately I flubbed it the first time but my team was able to pull through and did a good job. We then did a fun activity where we ranked a bunch of items on how vital they would be in a situation where your stranded at sea on a raft. After all the fun stuff we got to meet our high school member Mr. Ron. According to his words, he has great knoweldge in things like neuroscience, bio-medicine, computer science, and is a big fan of AI. He seems like a cool guy. After the meeting we went back to our research where I learned how to encode my labels within the Random Forest classifier. I also learned more about the fundamentals of machine learning, like supervised learning being the most used form of machine learning and how it puts as the teacher to our model's student.

reflection: |
  I need to improve my presentation skills in advance of the synposium next week Friday. I can't help but feel anxious about that day. Besides that, today was another good one. I enjoyed the activities we did both the game we played in the hall and the icebreaker given to us by Mr. Ron where we had ChatGPT predict our future job 15 years from now based on our hobbies and intrests. I said it before but just to repeat, Mr. Ron seems like a cool guy, he talked a little bit about all his experiences, how he's a Baltimore native and that if he's able to he'll take us around the city and other cool stuff like how he's training to be a veterinarian and that he's planning on using AI to create an app called Dr. Meow that uses your phone to scan your pet for any health complications. In regards to research it was a rather slow day. The videos we're watching place a lot of emphasis on the conceptual part of machine learning.
