what_i_learned: |
  Today I was introduced to the SAIRI program. I learned about the program coordinators and my fellow teammates through short introductions. We were made to take a placement test to gauge our Python skills which I unfortunately had so trouble with. I then underwent a game of speed networking with the rest of my peers and I was able to learn more about them. Our instructor Clyde then introduced us to Git and GitHub. I learned that Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes to the source code, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. We were later tessted on our Git knowledge through jeopardy which I greatly enjoyed. Finally, our day ended which the creation of our blogs through github.

   No Blockers!

reflection: |
  Overall, The Introduction was an enjoyable experience. The coordinators seem very experienced and knowledgable and the activities they made us do were rather brief (the placement) or really enjoyable (Speed Bingo and Jeopardy) Git and GitHub weren't nearly as complicated to understand as I previously thought. I'm am now more confident in my abilities in navigating the platform and using Git in my future work and in general I'm more confident that this whole program will be a worthwhile and enjoyable experience.
