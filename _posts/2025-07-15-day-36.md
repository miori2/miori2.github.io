what_i_learned: |

  Today I went to the business building in order to attend a SAIRI Cohort Connect featuring Dr. Riggs where she went over different personality types and how that can affect our project. Before that she had us do the same bingo activity we did in our orientation, this time in=person. Next she talked about the different learning styles we all have and our particular personality types using the VARK & Myers-Briggs questionnaire to determine what category we fall into. I got INFP and Mild Aural, meaning I'm a diplomatic person who learns best when someone is telling me what to do. We then ended the cohort with a presentation with our group members dicussing about personalities and learning styles and how that will affect the project. Back to my research work, Ms. Amara helped us better understand what the final outcome of our papers should be and gave us options on how we wanted to struture our methodology.

reflection: |

  I enjoyed today's Cohort Connect. At first I thought I wasn't going to like it due to us covering old ground with the bingo game but after that all the things Dr. Riggs had us do were enjoyable. I always enjoy doing these personality/learning style quizzes to get a better understanding of myself and even though I was a bit annoyed that we had another presentation to do out of the blue I felt as though it was a good exercise for me to practice my speaker skills for the final presetentation on August 1st. In regard to the research work done today, I was able to provide more detailed explanations about the methodology I used in the paper by explaining the importance of the metrics being used (MAE, MSE, RMSE), and discussing the accuracy scores of the model and why they are so high/low.
