  Today I attended the second part of the writing workshop hosted by Professor Pandey. This time she focused more on the presentation aspect of our research papers and how the papers should be structured. She gave us an example paper from last's year CEMALS program and told us what could be improved and how we can incoportate that in our own papers. For our presentation at the end of summer symposium she gave us all sorts of sound advice: how our slides should be structured, what our attire should look like, and how we can come together as group when we present by helping each other out if we are feeling nervous. She went back to explaining how we should structure our papers and started an activity where we provide a brief summary of a study we reviewed. After that we played a game of Kahoot and she ended the session by wishing us luck on our presentations. In my research work, I was able to draft the conclusion and future work sections of my paper, I will be reviewing all I wrote and making any changes neccesary tommorow.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed both of the writing workshops Professor Pandey held. I appreciate the energy and passion she has for research, speaking personally, she does a good job of teaching us the rules and standards of research in a palpable way. The slides themselves are also helpful as well, they serve as a good reference point when writing my own paper. I realized that I couldn't use colloquialism in my paper and that Times New Roman isn't the best font for presentations thanks to them. In regards to my research work, its going well but I feel as thought I will have to redo the experiment in order to validate the results I produced.
