what_i_learned: |
  Today I finished my MatLab training by learning how to plot graphs and the customizable features that come with that, such as changing the shape or color of my plots, or extending my x and y axises. I then started with the programming language R and its workplace R Studio. First I went through the basics of navigating the platform, how to run code, how to load libraries and packages, and how to clear everything when I'm done. I then went on to learn about R's implementation of basic graphics (graphs) for data analysis. I learned how to create Bar charts. Histograms, and scatterplots and when to use each one in relation to my data. I learned about the package pacman and the various libraries it entails. I learned how to overlay plots on another to be able to get more information in smaller space. Finally I learned about the summary and describe functions that give you a brief description of your code.

  In regards to MatLab, I had trouble with creating curves that showed the distribtuion of my graphs.

reflection: |
  Today was a busy day. Right after finishing the MatLab training we had to jump into another whole new programming language with its own quirks. I will say that I think plotting in R seems easier than it does in MatLab. I do find the customization of graphs an easier tasks in MatLab than in R though, as for some graphs R will ask you for the hex value of color to change it rather than just entering the name of the color, and to change shapes you have to enter some pch number. Another thing I found interesting in MatLab was how it seems to execute code line by line, rather than everything at once, which I guess is a bit more comfortable considering were dealing with short code at the moment.
