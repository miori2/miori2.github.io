what_i_learned: |
  Today I started work on a new research paper: 'Machine Learning: Algorithms, Real‐World Applications and Research
Directions'. This paper's acknowledges the modern age is the age of data, that everything in our lives is connected to a data source and for us to extract that data and transform it into intelligent applications that are capable of solving real-world problems, we need to use machine learning. The paper talks about the various machine learning methods (supevised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning) and goes into detail on each method's strengths & weaknesses, use cases, and what equations they favor. The paper also goes into detail on the data each method works best with and provides various visualizations of the performance of each method in various case examples.

  No blockers today.

  Compared to yesterday's research paper, I found this one to be a bit easier to parse. Part of that is probably because today's paper doesn't have any code to implement or even conducts experiments of its own. It just compares the performance of each method to established benchmarks. Today's paper was much more focus on the concepts that make up Machine Learning, which is something I actually appreciate as it gave me more insights into topics I thought I already had a grasp on. For example, supervised learning is when you train the algorithm on labeled data, I thought the labeled data meant the values of your label feature in your table. But it actually means that each training example you use has an input and correct output.
