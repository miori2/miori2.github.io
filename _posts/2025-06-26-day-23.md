  Today I started work on a new research paper: "Machine Learning: Algorithms, Real‐World Applications and Research Directions". This paper acknowledges that the modern age is the age of data — everything in our lives is connected to a data source. To extract that data and transform it into intelligent applications capable of solving real-world problems, we need to use machine learning. The paper discusses various machine learning methods (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning) and goes into detail on each method's strengths and weaknesses, use cases, and the equations they favor. It also explains the types of data each method works best with and provides visualizations of their performance in different real-world scenarios.

  No blockers today. 
  
reflection: |
  Compared to yesterday's research paper, I found this one easier to parse. That’s probably because today's paper doesn’t include code or conduct original experiments—it just compares each method’s performance against established benchmarks. The focus on core machine learning concepts helped deepen my understanding of topics I thought I already grasped. For example, I had thought "labeled data" in supervised learning simply meant the values in the label column of a dataset. But now I realize it means each training example has both an input and a correct, known output.
