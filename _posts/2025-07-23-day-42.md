  Today we worked on the second draft of the elevator pitch. This time I came up with the idea where each of us holds posters of the key points we're addressing. Basically we just write the question we addressing for example: 'How Does Your Research Incorporate AI?' and they we would give our answer without having to say the question out loud, reducing the time we take and added a bit of color and flair to our project. We took multiple takes on zoom and we are currently debating on which of the drafts we should use or if we should try again tommorow with a different style. The other work done today was touching up our research papers. Ms. Amara reviewed my work and pointed out some mistakes such as having different values for the RMSE diff for my training and testing data and balancing both my training and testing data with SMOTE instead of just the training data in order to avoid my models overfitting.

  No blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a good day. Our elevator pitch is facing some problems, the posters I brought aren't as effective as I thought. Since we are recording the pitch using zoom on our laptops we have to present our posters in a way that slightly covers our mouths. The posters are hard too see by themselves as well due to light from the sun and in my case a poor camera. I still really appreciate my group for trying out this idea though, and I also really appreciate the folks who I borrowed from to help create these visual aids. For my research paper, I been back and forth this week working on my own assigned paper and discussing who will do what task on the final collaborative paper. The same goes for our final presentation as well.
