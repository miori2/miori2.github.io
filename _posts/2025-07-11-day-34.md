  Today was once again another day of work on my research paper. Today I actually started from the beginning of my coding methodology. It turns out I've have been mistakenly using the custom ELM results for the traditional ELM. I think this error was due to us using Ms. Amara's ELM so we never had to import it from its official library. It's due to that convience that I had a hard time intializing it, we had to use hpelm instead of sklearn (the library used for the other models) due to it being phased out, the hardest part about it was actually training it since hpelm's ELM has a different logic than other models when taking args. After I was finally able to get it to worked I went through my code and corrected the results for ELM and also split my results into training and testing sets on OVerleaf for others to get a better idea of the pattern of performance.

  I had quite a bit of trouble implementing ELM.

  Today was pretty tedious. This is mainly coming from my experience with hpelm's ELM, I tried to implement it the same way I did the custom ELM but every time I got something right in one cell, the next one after would be giving me error message after error message. I'm really grateful for Ms. Amara today, it was thanks to her I was able to properly debug the training/testing datasets to properly train them on the ELM. After that I took a little break from coding and worked on the presentation with my groupmates. Then I was able to get the training and testing metrics for the ELM and was able to use it as a basis for computing the metrics for the other models.
