what_i_learned: |
  Today we started with the whole SAIRI program heading towards the business hall we always meet in. We met up with out coordinators and they asked us to summarize what we've been doing this week. After that we talked about things we could do as a group like go to NASA, go hiking, or just eating food while doing team activites like we did the first day. After the discussion we played some fun games of Taboo and Jenga and afterwards we were introduced to the application Overleaf which we will be using to build the research paper we'll be turning in at the end of this program. After Lunch, I went back to my Research Lab where I continued learning more about R Studio. In particular, I learned the various data formats in R (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, dataframes) and how I can change the data found in them to another type through coercion. I learned how to use Factors so that I can be able to label my data, and I ended the day with learning about the various functions I can use to enter data such as seq() which gives a list of integers depending on the value and scan() which lets you enter integers and have them be converted into an array/list.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed today's Cohort Connect even though I didn't participate in the games. Its just nice to see other faces and be out of the lab once in a while. I wonder how things like field trips will work if we actually get to go on some, will they be a whole day affair? I think that would be pretty cool. With Overleaf, I wonder when or how we will be using it, will it be the coordinators that direct us or will or mentors decide what we will be doing in it? I'm just curious. The lessons covered in R Studio were both informative and a good review, I wasn't actually sure the difference between things like vectors and lists and I learned about more distinct characteristics of other data structures such as matrices always being 2D (at least in R).
