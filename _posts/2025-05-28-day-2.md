what_i_learned: |
  Today me and my teammates were able to meet with our assigned faculty member and graduate student that will be guiding us throughout our project, Dr.Iyiola and Ms.Eze who were very curious and in turn very kind to us. Afterwards We were relocated into breakout groups depending on our proficiency in Python. I was placed in the beginner group, Python 101 where we were instructed by Clyde. He refreshed us on basic aspects of Python: functions, strings, what makes a string, operators and their advanced versions, print and type functions.  

  He would also introduce us to replit where we pratice example code and analyze why the output is what it is. He would package all the information we learned into Kahoot games, something I really enjoyed.

  At the end our program coordinator Michael brought us all back into one group to play headbands. A game where someone tries to guess what they are by asking questions and everyone can only answer with yes or no.

blockers: |
  Some of the more complex operations we did in python have me confused and somewhat intimidated. For example print(20 * 11 // 2 ** (4 + 10) % 6) something like this equation might lose me for a bit before I finally solve it.

reflection: |
  Meeting with the faculty has given me an idea of how big this program will be, seeing about 70 people day in and day out for 2 months will surely be an intresting experience. The activities that followed were very enjoyable, the bootcamp is both a relaxed yet invigorating refresher, and I found Headbands another fun teambuilding activity.
