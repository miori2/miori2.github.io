what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt more about the basic data types of Python: Ints, floats, strings, and bools. I learned how I can manipulate these data types through use of basic operators like +, -, /, and * and logical operators like and, or, and not. I learned more about how to create variable in Python through the use of an equal sign, and how I can assign multiple values to variables through a comma seperated sequence similar to a list.

  Speaking of lists, I learned about indexing, the ability to locate a specific object in a lists by adding the's object associated number/index to the end of a list name in square brackets. I learned to do the same for nested elements in a list where I use two indexes, the first to locate the nest I want to search and the second to locate the index of the object inside it.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today was a day of both reviewing and learning old and new topics. Some concepts such as logical operators not, and, and or I was taught in Clyde's camp, though I felt I was able to get a better understanding of them. I still learned plenty of new ways to manipulate them and I learned more about new concepts such as multiple variable creation and indexing. Overall a pretty good day.
