what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a guest speaker, a previous alumni of the program. He introduced us to Computer Vision, which is essentially the way computers simulate the sight of humans to perceive and interpret information. Our speaker had us complete activites through the platform Google colab to perform tasks such as image classification and object detection on images we uploaded. Afterwards, we went through a session of virtual escape rooms with our teammates. Finally, we went back to our Python camps. In 101, we learned about concepts such as variables, typecasting, and the I/O cycle

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  The presentation from the speaker was both an enjoyable and eye-opening experience. This was an area of computer science I knew little about, so to finally experience and realizing how simple it is to get into really is great. I also enjoyed the escape room I experienced with my teammates. Out of all the activities we have done, this is the one I enjoyed the most. Python 101 continues to be refreshing course, I feel as though I gain more confidence in my abilities day by day.
