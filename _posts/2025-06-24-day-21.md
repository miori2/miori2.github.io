  In the morning all of us SAIRI particpants were gathered in the business building to have a meeting with our program leader Dr. Mack. She basically asked questions and reminded us about the procedures to do see if our check has processed and to fill out the required form in case we won't be at work on certain day. She also gave us a brief rundown on the presentation heading into Friday and what exactly we're expected to present, she notably talked about a Demo video that is basically a demonstration of the work we've done so far on our project, which is a bit hard our for group since our project isn't really tangible the same way a website or an app is and we had to come together with our mentors to figure out what will use as our demo video. In the afternoon me and the rest of my team did our literature review on our assigned research papers. The paper I was assigned was titled 'Comparative analysis of heart disease prediction using logistic regression, SVM, KNN and random forest with cross-validation for improved accuracy' as you could guess from the title. the accuracy aforementioned machine learning methods were compared on a heart disease dataset to determine which model is best fit for heart disease prediction.

reflection: |
  Today a good day for us as a team. The meeting Dr. Mack held in the morning was helpful in getting ready for our presentation, I'm really grateful that the time was cut down from 20 to 15 minutes since I wasn't too confident that we could make a presentation that long. The meeting also lead to a meeting with our mentors where they assured us that we actually have been working on our project the whole time because I was also under the assumption that the videos were just tutorials and we've really started work on the project yet. While trying to parse the desired information is tiring, I enjoyed our research paper review as it feels somewhat similar to what we're doing just with more of a focus on cross-validation than math equations. Also shout-out to Dr. Mack for giving us more time for our lunch break and Mr. Ron for buying us smoothies. That was cool.
