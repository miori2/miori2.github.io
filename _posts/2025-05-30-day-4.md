  Today we started our 3rd and pontentially last day of Python lessons. Our Python 101 instructor Clyde taught us concepts such a booleans and keywords that we can use to evaluate comparisons to our code. We also learned about relational operations like greater than and less than alongside logical operators like not that is a negation that will turn a false statement into a true one. He tested our knowledge with Kahoots and a project that has us determine the test score of a student and assign them a grade based on the number they entered.

  Clyde also gave us an introduction to Generative AI, we gave us a brief description of Gen AI an how its powered and gave us a breif history of how AI has evolved from its inception in 1956. He had us mess around with AI sites such as Suno AI to make music as an activity. We learned about more advanced topics such as LLMs, tokenization, and Neural Networking systems, we were once again tested on this knowledge through kahoots.

  Finally, we split into our project groups to determine which pictures in a slideshow are AI generated or not. We then went back into the main group to find out if we were right about each picture.

   Within the Student Grade Evaluator project in replit. I had difficulty seperating my else statement from some of my if statements. So I'm still trying to figure that out.

reflection: |
  Today was a very fun yet rigourous day. The python lessons today were probably the most complex, but I think I was able to come away with a good idea of how to utilize conditionals. The Gen AI concepts were much easier to comprehend due to topics we've covered before making a reappearance such as neural networking systems. I really enjoyed the activities we did today from the kahoots to the picture guessing. All in all this was a great week.
