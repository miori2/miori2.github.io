  Today we continued work on our research paper and presentation. Today I worked a bit on the earlier research paper assigned to us by Dr. Iyiola to fill in any sections that I had not completed. Afterwards I met with Ms. Amara who instructed me to work on the 'Challenges' section of our presentation. I met with each member of the group and took notes of all the trouble they faced throughout the program and wrote down the problems that came up the most. For the 'Solutions Implemented' part, I focused on how our graduate mentor, Ms. Amara, and the resources she provided were used to overcome any adversities. Finally, I worked on the literature review section of our research paper. I reviewed the two research papers assigned to me and talked about the goals of their paper, their methodolgies and findings, and identifying knowledge gaps and how that related to our project.

reflection: |
  Today didn't feature any coding, moreso literature work. I'm happy I was able to complete the challenges section of our slideshow, as aside from one the literature review slides and future work, I wasn't able to help out much with the slides due to being focused on debugging my code and the sections I was assigned in my research paper. Regarding the research paper, I already had the structure of the literature review in mind so typing it out wasn't too hard, my main problem was trying to parse the information I needed. The papers that were provided, specifically the paper discussing cross-validation in machine learning, have so much text that isn't properly format that its a chore to go through. Thankfully with help from the notes taken when we first got them and some assitance from Ms. Amara and other members, I was able to finish my work.
