  Today we had a writing workshop in the morning. Representatives from Morgan's writing center came to talk to us about building our research papers. First off the male speaker, Mr. Abbott, talked with us about the preconceptions people have when writing essays: writer's block, overwriting, difficulty with citations, etc. He then passed it off to the main speaker (whose name escapes me at the moment) and she brought out a PowerPoint detailing the importance of writing and how the template to follow when writing. A notable one she gave us was the PEACC method (Problem, Ethicality, Accuracy, Clarity, Completeness) to rely on when building our papers. She then gave us an exercise to build our problem statement and a catchy title to go with it. After the seminar and our break, I went back to the office and continued work evaluating the metrics of my ELM with different activation functions (Sigmoid, tanh, relu).

  No blockers. It took a while though.
  
reflection: |

  I enjoyed today's SAIRI Cohort Connect. I already like to write (not essays though) so this was a welcomed workshop. I enjoyed both of the speakers today, I found the topics and problems people have with writing really informative and the main speaker brought up facts that I found interesting like how people in Middle Eastern countries consume a lot cumene which might help with memory and prevent them from being afflicted with diseases like Alzheimers over here in the western world. I found the first steps of building our research papers fun, our group already has experience but it was still enjoyable. For my research work today, admittedly I wasn't able to accomplish too much, I was focused on debugging my cross-validation process with the various activation functions.
