what_i_learned: |
 Today me and my project group worked in Matlab for the first time. If you don't know what that is, Matlab is basically a programming language designed for numerical computing. Basically its good for solving math problems and data analysis. Similar to what we did in Python, we were given a video playlist where each video showcased a new topic for us to learn about. Despite being created with the use of C, a lot of the functions/commands overlapped with what we did in Python. Functions like sqrt(), pi, and abs() alongside funcs that I though were unique to Python like ceil, floor, and the use of conditionals still made their way into MatLab. Though they do have their differences of course as MathLab enables the creation of matrices and uses its command line more than Python. It also has functions that do similar things but are named different, like disp() and fprintf() is used to display text in MatLab versus Python's print.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Overall learning MatLab has been an easier experience than expected. Some of functions I've encountered such as exp() and polyval are still giving me some trouble, but I imagine I will get a better understanding of them as I go through the platform just like Python's more advanced concepts. I'm really supriesed on how well my Python experience transfers over here, I figured we would be starting from rock bottom again but luckily that's not the case. My only fear at the moment is when we start dealing with advanced math concepts, as I not someone who can say they're confident in their mathematical skills.
