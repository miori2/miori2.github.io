what_i_learned: |
  Today I held the presentation with my peers where we discussed what we learnedt today. I discussed how the python operations and data types I learned, the importance of libraries such as Numpy and Pandas in data analysis and how they will impact our work and they data structures they contain, and how I can convert files into said data structures like turning an excel file to a DataFrame (Pandas table essentially). After the presentation I learned about how I could control the flow of my code through If, else, and elif statements. I also learned how to create functions to handle tasks that built-in Python ones aren't fit to handle and how to document information on how they work. The day ended with us giving another presentation on everything we learned this week to our mentors, where they then proceeded to teach us topics that we will be dealing with in our research.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  I think the main takeaway for me today that isn't coding related is for me to better prepare beforehand what I'll say before my we present on Friday. I think I did a decent job but I know I can do better. In regards to my research, I gained a better understanding of to customize the execution of my code through else, if, and elif statements and how to create functions.
