what_i_learned: |
  Today we had another spokeperson come talk to us in the auditorium: Dr. Crawford and Human-Computer Interfaces. Dr. Crawford introduced us to the concept of human and computer interaction where we things such as being able to move a robotic arm with just your mind are able to be done. Dr. Crawford talked about his own invention of being able to control drones with movements such as clenching your teeth or blinking. After the lecture, he along with his graduate students took up upstairs to participate in some Human/Computer activities such as flying a drone or moving a little AI cart around with just our minds/arms. After the activites and the lunch break, our group reconvened at the research lab to work on our final research paper and start on our final presentation. I was able to complete the introduction and analysis of data used sections of the paper today.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed the workshop we had today. Dr. Crawford and his graduate student seem like fun people and their topic and activities were probably the best ones out of all the speakers. I unfortunately didn't get too test out the technology in the activities due to supply constraints but what I did experience was really cool. This is one of the avenues I would be intrested in working in as a computer scientist. Back to our research work, I think we are all making great progress. We met up with Dr. Iyiola with our weekly zoom meeting where he congratulated us on our work and asked us how we felt of our overall experience in the program. Unless something crazy happens next week, I enjoyed my time and felt I learned a lot in CEMALS.
