what_i_learned: |
  I attended the first in person Day of the SAIRI program. I was reintroduced to my peers, mentors, and the program coordinators. We had a discussion on the importance on proper regulation on the development and use of AI alongside the importance of the role dependent and independent variables play in the training of AI models. Afterwards, me and my project team participated in a teambuilding activity where we were tasked in seeing how high up we could take a marshmellow using only uncooked spaghetti sticks, thanks to our cooperation with our mentors we were able to build a first prize structure. Afterwards we relocated to our research lab where our mentors introduced us to other graduate students that we could use as resources and shared and explained the tools we will be using throughout the summer: Anaconda, Mathlab, SPSS, and Juptyer notebooks.

  Finally, I ended the day with video tutorials of Python work in Jupyter Notebooks where I learned about libraries and how to import them. For example, I import the library math into my notebook, and gained access to functions such as math.log(), where it takes the natural logarithm of whatever is inside its parenthesis/argument, and math.exp() which raises e to the power of its arguement.

  The biggest challenge I had this day was downloading Anaconda and starting up Jupyter Notebooks within it. I was confused as the version of Juptyer Notebooks in Anaconda is different from the one provided in the videos sent to us. After getting some assistance I was able to get back on track but I still have some problems such as pulling the terminal. 

reflection: |
  Overall. today was a nice introduction to how things will flow on a day by day basis. My current goal at this moment is to review the links provided to me by Dr.Eze and make sure I am able to retain the knowledge the provide. I hope this program will be a great time for everyone involved.
