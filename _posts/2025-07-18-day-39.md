what_i_learned: |
  Today we started finishing up our current research papers. I started off the day doing a review of my code to clean it up and add some things that were missing (training resutls for some models, activation functions, etc). Inside my code I had to redo the cross-validation process for both unbalanced data and balanced data due to an error I made when training some of the models and not assigning them to data objects. After that was I done I updated my tables in Overleaf and my methodology. I produced visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts and histograms. for all the metrics we've been evaluating and was able to provide brief captions as to why their are important. Finally I was able to finish my conclusion and future work sections of my paper.

  No blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Today I focused more on reviewing the contents of my paper. Our high school teacher Ron was able to help me out with the literature parts of the paper so I'm very thankful to him for that. I'm also grateful I was able to redo most of my code today and was able to organize it in a way that made it easy for me to call the variables when producing the visualizations. Despite the title I'm still not fully done with my paper, I need to create more charts explaining the distrubtion of my original dataset and what that could mean for the performance for my models. Dr. Iyiola also recommended that we isolate the custom ELM variants (sigmoid, tanh, relu) and compare which model is most effective at the beginning of the paper so we only have to focus on one during the evaluation process.
