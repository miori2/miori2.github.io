what_i_learned: |
  Today was our second day of MatLab training where I picked off on the video regarding implementation of conditionals in MatLab. I went though implementing For, Else and Elif loops and also messed around with logical operations AND and OR, which is represented as | in MatLab. I then went on to learn about how to create FOR and WHILE loops in and went through various implementations of them. For example, we were asked to create a for loop where when iterating on a matrix, if it happens to encounter a value of 1 it will change the following value to 2. To end things off I learnt about switch cases, where I feel the based way to describe them is switch chooses a variable, and cases as elif statements where if its true its line will execute.

reflection: |
  Implementing loops in MatLab isn't at all a drastic departure from how it is in Python. I'm quite grateful for this fact because now I know what I'm learning will be carried over between the two programming langugages. These videos also served as good review for me, as I was better able to understand how to manipulate the loops through the use of the length() function in combination with 'for i' which lets be access every value in the matrix. Switch cases were something I didn't recognize yet their value isn't lost on me. With the way I see they are an easier method of controlling the flow of your code then loops.
