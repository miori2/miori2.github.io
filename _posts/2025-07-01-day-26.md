  Today we as a group came together to work on our mid-summer presentation. We were able to sort out the roles each of us would have: I would introduce the group and give the summary of the project and I would also go over the literature review along with Roji & Nigam. Afterwards Deyo would come in and give the project summary and what our expected outcome is. Then starting with me we would talked about our acheivements and contributions to the project and what challenges we faced and how we were able to overcome them. Nigam would go over the data we found and then we would play our Demo Video of us going over one of the research papers we created. I also continued to do some work on my own research paper on the side, I was able to implement the custom ELM our mentors made into my work and was able to evaluate its metrics (Accuracy, MAE, RMSE).

reflection: |
  Today was a combination of research work and getting ready for the presentation. Even though we assigned the roles we haven't finished our slides. Ms. Amara gave us a template for what we could say which was helpful and our high school teacher Mr. Ron was able to help us do a practice run for our Demo Video and how we can improve on our delivery. Deyo wants us to go for a more creative route for our presentation but our faculty mentor wants us to stick to the provided template so we'll see how that goes. Overall I hope we are able to do a good job.
